[Grid - Plan ]

-Different colors to denote the tetris shapes. Each shape must have its own four sides (2 for squares). Then you can draw over each pixel to "move" the shapes by adding, multiplying
or increasing/decreasing position relative to accepted input of keyboard press

[Grid - Blank]

-I had this up while I was writing because it helped me vizualize the logic. I just pulled a random grid off the internet
